    "# ASTR3110 Computer Laboratory 3: Classifying Images using Artificial and Convolutional Neural Networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Lab, you will be using imaging from the [CORNISH](https://cornish.leeds.ac.uk/public/index.php) survey to classify images using Neural Networks. The CORNISH survey aimed to understand massive star formation in our Galaxy by searching for ultra-compact HII regions (regions that have stars with mass > 8 times the mass of our Sun that are ionising the surrounding gas, which emit at radio wavelengths) in a portion of the plane of the disk of the Galaxy using the [Very Large Array Radio telescope](http://www.vla.nrao.edu). \n",
    "\n",
    "While this survey successfully discovered many new HII regions, other sources such as planetary nebulae (PNE) and background galaxies (RGs) also emit at radio wavelengths. By design, the CORNISH survey targetted a region that also contained observations in the mid-infrared taken drung another survey with the Spitzer Space telescope ([the GLIMPSE survey](https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SPITZER/GLIMPSE/)). In particular, the 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 $\\mu$m Spitzer images allow us to distinguish HII regions, PNE, and RGs due to their differnt appearance (see top panel in the below image: leftmost is a PNE, middle a HII region, and right a RG).\n",
    "\n",
    "![SegmentLocal](CORNISH_image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part of the lab, you will train and test an Artificial Neural Network classifier using 300 8.0 $\\mu$m images (100 each for HII, PNE, and RG sources).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second part of the lab, you will train and test a Convolutional Neural Network classifier, using the same sample as in Part One, but adding the 4.5 and 5.8 $\\mu$m images. \n",
    "\n",
    "In both parts, you will need to run tests. to detyermine the performance of your classifier, and tweak hyperparameters  in order to improve the performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the completion of this lab, you will have acquired (or improved) the following skills:\n",
    "- Reading in fits images using astropy.\n",
    "- Manipulating 2D image arrays to prepare them for input into the ANN and CNN architectures (using the ndimage and numpy packages).\n",
    "- Using the keras packages for setting up and running ANN and CNN. classifiers.\n",
    "- Using Scikit Learn and other packages to assess the performance of ANN and CNN classifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to turn in your completed notebook for marking (an upload link appear on iLearn later). You will be marked on the following with equal weight:\n",
    "- Comments: Your code must be commented. You can either do this by adding explanation text placed in blocks just before code blocks OR as comments within the code blocks themselves. Your comments should demonstrate that you understand what your code is doing, and why! You will be marked based on the clarity of your comments, and whether your comments indicate that you understand your code. If using markdown cells, please consider using colour to distinguish your comments from the existing instructions in the notebook.\n",
    "- Plots should be well presented and explained: E.g., reasonable axes (e.g., ranges should be set so that trends are clearly visible), clear axis labels. You should also explain the \"why\" and \"what\" of your plots. Why are you plotting this? What does your plot show?\n",
    "- Formatting of your code (easy to understand, sensible variable names etc.)\n",
    "- Clear explanations and/or justifications of experiments to design a better classifier.\n",
    "- Comments and explanation on a final best classifier and performance results."
