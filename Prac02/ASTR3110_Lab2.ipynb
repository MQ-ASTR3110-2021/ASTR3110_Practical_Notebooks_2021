    "# ASTR3110 Computer Laboratory 2: Determining star cluster membership with Gaia data and Gaussian Mixuture Modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will again make use of data from the Gaia Data Release 2 (Gaia DR2). This time you will use the position (R.A., decl.), proper motions (pmRA, pmdec), and distance measurements from Gaia to identify open clusters using Gaussian Mixture Modelling (GMM). You will also identify which stars in the data are most likely gravitationally bound members of the clusters. By identifying which stars in a region of sky belong to different star clusters, it is possible to investigate the properties of the open clusters such as their kinematics, stellar populations etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part of the lab, you will download and then get to know your data, eliminating spurious data points using the techniques you learned in Lab 1, as well as performing task-specific filtering of the data. Then, you will explore the data by producing a series of plots that will help you better understand the data, and will also guide your decision making for future analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second part of the lab, you will begin to use the [scikit learn GMM package](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.mixture.GaussianMixture.html) to identify star clusters in the data. This will require an amount of experimentation, which will help you to become familiar with using the GMM. You will refine your analysis to a point where you can isolate the clusters in the data and use the GMM fits to determine the stars with the greatest likelihood of being gravtitationally bound members of those clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will plot separate colour-magnitude diagrams for the clusters you have found in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the completion of this lab, you will have acquired (or improved) the following skills:\n",
    "- Data filtering using Pandas.\n",
    "- Manipulating data to derive required parameters.\n",
    "- Plotting data and interpreting plots using matplotlib and seaborn.\n",
    "- Using scikit learn Gaussian Mixture Modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Lab is to be submitted as a publication-style report (details will appear on iLearn later), which will be worth 25\\% of your final grade. You should also submit your notebook alongside your report. In completing your notebook, keep in mind the following pointers for good coding practice, and will also help when it is time to write your report, where you will be expected to explain what you have done during your analysis, and interpret results.\n",
    "- Comments: Your code should always be commented. You can either do this by adding explanation text placed in blocks just before code blocks OR as comments within the code blocks themselves. Your comments should demonstrate that you understand what your code is doing, and why! \n",
    "- Plots should be well presented and explained: E.g., reasonable axes (e.g., ranges should be set so that trends are clearly visible), clear axis labels. You should be able to explain the \"why\" and \"what\" of your plots. Why are you plotting this? What does your plot show?\n",
    "- Formatting of your code (easy to understand, sensible variable names etc.)\n",
    "- Explanations and/or justification for cuts made on the data.\n",
    "- Comments/answers to any questions posed in the notebooks as well as comments on interpretation/comparison of results. "

We will also be using the photometric data to plot colour-magnitude diagrams for the detected clusters. \n",

This selection helps to weed out stars for which the astrometric solution used to determine position, parallax, and proper motion has failed due to, e.g., unresolved companion stars that affect the measuremnts.\n",

These problematic sources need to be removed.\n",
